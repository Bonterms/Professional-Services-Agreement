# Professional Services Agreement

## About Bonterms
[Bonterms](https://bonterms.com/) is simplifying commercial contracting through Standard Agreements. Our enterprise Cloud Terms (with DPA and SLA Attachments), Professional Services Agreement (PSA) and Mutual NDA let the parties start from a balanced foundation and negotiate by Cover Page, not redlines. The Bonterms Platform will leverage our Standard Agreements to take collaborative dealmaking to the next level. Bonterms is lawyer-led and funded by XYZ Capital and Wilson Sonsini.

## How the Professional Services Agreement was Created
The PSA was drafted by the [Bonterms Standard Agreement Committee](https://bonterms.com/committee/). The PSA went through seven major drafts and multiple meetings, surveys and discussions over eight months.

## How to Use
1. **Review** the PSA Terms with your lawyer.
2. **Prepare** your Cover Page ([example](https://bonterms.com/forms/cloud-terms-cover-page-example/)).
- Identify the parties and **Key Terms**: Effective Date, Rights in Deliverables, Governing Law and Courts.
- Note: for **Rights in Deliverables**, you must specify if Deliverables will be provided as Licensed Deliverables or Assigned Deliverables by default ([example](bonterms.com)).
- Propose anyÂ **Additional Terms** ([examples](bonterms.com)).
3. **Incorporate** any Attachments by reference.
4. **Send** your Cover Page (and Attachments) to your counterparty.
- Add a cover note or try our [Explainer](https://bonterms.com/forms/bonterms-explainer/).
5. **Negotiate** the Cover Page and Attachments.
6. **Sign** the Cover Page and create your **Agreement**!
7. **Issue** or receive SOWs ([example](bonterms.com)).
